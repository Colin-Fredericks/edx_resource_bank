	<p>Block 1, of mass m<sub>1</sub>, is connected over an ideal (massless and frictionless) pulley to block 2, of mass m<sub>2</sub>, as shown. Assume that the blocks accelerate as shown with an acceleration of magnitude a and that the coefficient of kinetic friction between block 2 and the plane is \( \mu \).</p>

	<p>Find the ratio of the masses \( m_1 / m_2 \).</p>

<h2>Note on Quiz Problems</h2>

<p>Quizzes allow fewer attempts than checkpoint or homework problems. Most give no more than three attempts.</p>

<p>Be sure to make every attempt count! Since these quizzes are not timed, you will be able to carefully consider your answers and check them over before submitting them.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

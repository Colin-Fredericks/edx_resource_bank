<body>

<p>Each week Dr. Pritchard or another course staff member will answer your questions via video. Please use the discussion below to ask questions about Unit 3. We will answer the three top-voted questions as of <b>11:59 PM (GMT) on Monday July 1st</b>. The videos will be posted before the quiz is due.</p>

<p>You should only ask one question per post. Be sure to check whether someone has already asked your question - upvoting a single post will be more effective at getting that question answered than having many posts with only a few votes each.</p>

<p>If your question does not get answered, you can check the <a href="https://www.edx.org/courses/MITx/8.MReV/2013_Summer/discussion/forum">discussion boards</a> or the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/MITx/8.MReV/2013_Summer/wiki/8.MReV/">wiki</a> to see if someone has answered the question there.</p>

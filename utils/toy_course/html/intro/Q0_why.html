<h2>Introductory Quiz</h2>

<p>It may seem strange to start a course with a quiz, but it is important for you to take this quiz, especially because this course is for people with "some knowledge of mechanics":</p>

<ol>
	<li>It will give us important insight into what you and the class bring to the course in terms of various skills.</li>
	<li>It will give you practice taking a quiz (and will not count in your grade).</li>
	<li>It will give you an idea of the variety of problem types you'll experience in this course.</li>
	<li>In the future analysis of these data we will be able to give new students guidance on whether they're ready for this course.</li>
</ol>

<p>So we hope you will make a conscientious effort to do well on this quiz.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Pritchard</p>

<h2>Post-Course Quiz</h2>

<p>As we started with a quiz, we also end with one. If you took Quiz Zero at the beginning of the course, we recommend you take this one as well.</p>

<ol>
	<li>It will give us important insight into what you learned during the course</li>
	<li>It will not count in your grade.</li>
	<li>In the future analysis of these data we will be able to give new students guidance on whether they're ready for this course.</li>
</ol>

<p>So we hope you will make a conscientious effort to do well on this quiz.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Pritchard</p>

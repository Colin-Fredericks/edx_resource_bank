      <p>
Two construction workers each of mass m raise themselves on a hanging platform using pulleys as shown above. If the platform has a mass of $n<b/>m, the initial distance between the pulleys and the platform is d, and the workers each pull with a force f on the ropes, what is the acceleration a of the workers? Assume the pulleys and ropes are massless.<br/>

Explanation:<br/>
Let's define our system to be the platform and the workers together. There is the force of gravity downward equal to (2+$n)*m*g and then a force upward equal to 4*f. So the net force is 4f-(2+$n)*m*g. So the acceleration = total force/ total mass = (4f-(2+$n)*m*g)/ ((2+$n)*m).

<h2>Gravity and Orbits</h2>

<p>The history of man's views of planetary motion is a record of the state of human thought. The triumph of Newton's incredibly precise understanding and its ability to predict years into the future is arguably the greatest triumph of the scientific method to date. Its unification of earthly gravity and heavenly motion was a major philosophical revolution.</p>
<p>Ancient people knew that the heavenly bodies moved against a background of the fixed stars &mdash; starting with the sun, moon, and planets. The planets especially seemed to possess magical powers as they travelled strange paths, some staying close to the sun while others generally proceeded eastward through the heavens but with occasional reversals of direction ("retrograde motion"). So beautiful (before the advent of lighted cities), and with such puzzling motions, planetary motion intrigued humans and prodded them to create explanations. From ancient times, planets were taken as omens portending the future, and their mysterious nature was personified by considering them as gods and goddesses. Prehistoric astronomers built stone monuments that provided lines of sight to find the times when the sun and moon reached important heavenly landmarks, indicating, for example, the arrival of Spring.</p>

<h3>Gravity and Greek Views</h3>

<p>We experience gravity from the moment we are born, hence it seems completely natural &mdash; we struggle against gravity as we first seek to stand <i>up</i> and later we struggle to understand it as we grow <i>up</i> &mdash; both as individuals and as scientists. This struggle continues today as we try to find a satisfactory theory of gravity that is quantized.</p>
<p>The Greeks regarded gravity as a natural force since it had no apparent source and could not be modified or shielded. In fact, they thought the natural state of an object was at rest at the center of the earth (whose radius Eratosthenes had measured to about 15% accuracy around 240 BC).</p>
<p>The Greek/Roman Ptolemy (around 140 AD) modeled the motion of heavenly bodies in terms of concentric spheres, circular cycles, and epicycles, putting earth (and thereby man) at the center of the universe. Based on this flawed theory, his <i>Handy Tables</i> nevertheless gave accurate predictions of planetary motion and eclipses.</p>

<h3>The Scientific Revolution</h3>

<p>The heart of the scientific method is skepticism, the constant questioning of accepted ideas based on new and old evidence. Copernicus was the first skeptic about Ptolemy's earth-centered view. He was certain that his proposal that the sun was the center of the universe with the planets rotating around it would be considered heretical by the church. So he waited to publish <i>On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres</i> until he was close to death in 1543.</p>
<p>The planets motivated the first "big science" &mdash; the observatory of Tycho Brahe supported by various Kings in the late part of the 16<sup>th</sup> century. His team's measurements consisted of angular positions of planets made with large metal sighting circles (but without telescopes, of course). They were so careful and accurate that when Johannes Kepler found a systematic discrepancy of 8 minutes of arc (1/8 of a degree, about 3 times the resolution limit of the eye) in the positions of Mars, he decided that the orbits were not circles with circular corrections, but rather were ellipses. Published as <i>Astronomia Nova</i> (New Astronomy, 1609), his three laws summarized years of painstaking measurements, and posed the challenge of explaining these laws.</p>
<p>Newton was keenly aware that, since the planets and the moon did not move in a straight line, there must be a force on them from the sun. His great insight was <i>universal gravity</i> &mdash; that the moon was attracted to the earth by the same gravitational force that pulled the apple from the tree. His great triumph was using his laws of motion together with his newly invented calculus to show that the elliptical orbits found by Kepler would result if the gravitational force varied inversely as separation squared. Others, notably Hooke, had proposed an inverse square law, but Newton was the first to show that this hypothesis led rigorously to predictions in accord with observations. Today it is still the agreement of predictions of planetary and satellite positions that provides the best test of the inverse square law together with the F = ma relationship.</p>
<p>More modern observations reveal discrepancies with Newtonian predictions. An important discrepancy, discovered by Le Verrier in 1860, is that the axis of Mercury does not remain fixed in direction, but changes about 0.007 minutes of arc per year. This is consistent with Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, and is one of the crucial reasons why scientists today accept this theory.</p>
<p>The General Theory explains the effects of gravity as originating in the local curvature of space-time rather than as being due to the "action at a distance" of Newtonian gravitation. Ironically, this is something of a return to the Greek view that gravity is a natural force, different from the force due to electrostatic interactions for example. Physicists are still working on a theory that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>

<h3>Orbits and Models</h3>

<p>The motion of planets, comets, and spacecraft realizes motion without friction or drag exceptionally well &mdash; else the planets would have long ago crashed into the sun. Thus this motion holds mechanical energy constant. Furthermore the gravitational force is central, hence angular momentum about the sun is constant. Additionally, since the force law is known (as a function of position), it is possible to apply the <i>Dynamics and Net Force</i> model, or sometimes Kepler's Laws. Thus orbital problems provide numerous opportunities for you to practice identifying which problem characteristics suggest the application of which core models.</p>

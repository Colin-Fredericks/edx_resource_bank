<h2>Rotational Dynamics and Net Torque Model with Moment of Inertia</h2>
<h3>Learning goals</h3>
<p>After working through this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
	<li>Apply the Rotational Dynamics and Net Torque model in simple problems.</li>
	<li>Find the moment of inertia of an object</li>
	<li>Compare the moment of inertia of two objects</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rotational Dynamics and Net Torque &mdash; Model</h3>
<p>The Rotational Dynamics and Net Torque is one of the core models of Mechanics. It is summarized here:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<h4>Angular Dynamics and Net Torque</h4>
<p>Prerequisite Knowledge</p>
<ul>
	<li>Concepts: Fixed Axis, Torque, Moment of Inertia, Angular acceleration</li>
	<li>Procedures for finding torque, moment of inertia, parallel axis theorem</li>
</ul>
<p><b>System:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Objects:</b> Single Rigid Bodies Rotating about Fixed Axis A</li>
	<li><b>State Variables:</b> \(\theta(t), \omega(t), I_A\)</li>

<p><b>Law of Change</b></p>

<p>\(I_A \omega_{A,f} = I_A \omega_{A,f} + \int \tau_A^{net}(t)dt\)</p>
<p>Note: This relation is restricted to problems where a body rotates about a fixed z-axis. If the body is asymmetric, the axis must provide x and y forces on the object.</p>

<h3>Analogy of Rotational Dynamics with Linear Dynamics (Newton's Second Law)</h3>
<p>By analogy to the manner in which force changes velocity</p>
<p>\(\sum\vec{F}^{external}=m \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} =m\vec{a} \)</p>
<p>the angular dynamics and net torque model has a similar equation of change, but for rotational velocity around a fixed axis. If we apply a non zero torque on an object (e.g. push or pull on a door handle), it will result in a change of rotational motion &mdash; e.g. the door will start to rotate faster or slower about its (fixed) hinges.</p>
<p>By analogy (see rigorous derivation presented later), the angular velocity of an object rotating about an axis that passes through a point Q, is changed by the net torque on the object measured about point Q:</p>
<p>\[\sum\vec{\tau}_Q^{external} = I_Q \frac{d \omega}{dt} = I_Q \vec{\alpha} \]</p>
<p>Where \(\alpha\) is the <strong>angular acceleration</strong>: the rate of change of the angular speed \(\omega\), and \(\displaystyle I_Q\) is the <strong>moment of inertia</strong> about point Q, a quantity that is analogous to the inertial mass in \( \sum\vec{F}^{external}=m\vec{a} \).</p>
<p>The Linear Dynamics and Net Force model and the Angular Dynamics and Net Torque model both deal with the <i>dynamics</i> &mdash; the rate of change of the velocity variable. Because they both deal with a single object, the velocities can be integrated (given the initial position and velocity) to give the fullest possible account of the motion &mdash; the position vs. time.</p>
<p>Although the mathematical forms of the equations of change are quite similar, rotational dynamics differs from linear dynamics in important respects. Firstly, it applies to systems consisting of a single rotating object (rather than a point particle). Secondly, the motion variable is rotational velocity rather than translational velocity. Thirdly, the agent of change is the net torque (not the net force). Perhaps most importantly: the angular dynamics and net torque model makes <b><i>no sense</i></b> unless an axis of rotation is specified in advance.</p>

<h3>Moment of Inertia</h3>
<p>The Moment of inertia quantifies the inertia of an object for rotational motion and depends on how the mass is distributed with respect to the axis of rotation.</p>

<h4>Moment of Inertia of a Point Particle</h4>
<p>Consider a point particle of mass <i>M</i> moving in a circle of radius <i>R</i>, the moment of inertia of the point particle measured with respect to the center of the circle is given by \( I_Q=  M R^2 \), where <b><i>Q</i></b> is the point at the center of the circle.</p>
<p>The moment of inertia of a system of more than one point particle can be obtained by adding the moment of inertia of the individual particles. The moment of inertia of N point particles rotating about an axis passing through point Q is given by:</p>
<p>\(I_Q=\sum_{i=1}^{i=N}m_ir_i^2\)</p>
<p>where <i>m<sub>i</sub></i> is the mass of particle <i>i</i> and <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> is the distance between the particle <i>i</i> and the axis passing through point <i>Q</i>.</p>

<h2>Finding the moment of inertia of an extended object requires an integral.</h2>
<p>To find the moment of inertia of a rigid object, we essentially consider the object as a collection of tiny masses. Then we figure out how far the masses are from the axis of rotation and perform a sum over the masses.</p>
<p>\( I= \text{sum of: lumps of mass} \times (\text{the distance from the axis of rotation})^2 \)</p>
<p>In the infinitesimal limit, the sum process over all the masses becomes an integration, and the expression for the moment of inertia becomes:</p>
<p>\( I_Q =\int r_{\bot}^{2}\; dm \)</p>

<p>Most of the time you do not need to perform the actual integration. However if you do need to do that, you should notice that:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
	<li><i>dm</i> represents the small lump of mass. In practicality, the mass of the small lump is its volume 
	multiplied by the density, so it is usually expressed in term of \(\rho dx dy dz\) or \(\rho r dr d\theta dz\) or \(\rho r^2 sin(\theta) dr d\theta d\varphi\). The choice of which one to use depends on the coordinate system for your integral.</li>
	<li>\(r_{\bot}\) is the perpendicular distance of that \(dm\) from the axis, in terms of the coordinate system that you pick.</li>
	<li>This is a definite integral: you are summing over the object, and the limits are usually the boundaries of the object.</li>
	<li>Often the object can be considered in one or two dimensions (e.g. a thin rod or a thin disk), which will simplify the integral.</li>
</ul>

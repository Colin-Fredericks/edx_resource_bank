<p> The same torque is applied in the 3 situations. Notice that (a) the rod has the largest angular acceleration with no attached masses, (b) less when the masses are present, but close to the center, and (c) that the angular acceleration of the rod is much smaller when it has the masses attached at the ends. </p>

<h3>
			Illustrative Example: Pulling a Yo-Yo</h3>
<b>working on this one</b>
<p>
Consider a  yo-yo consisting of two solid disks, each of the same mass and radius <i>a</i>,
connected by a central spindle of radius <i>b</i> and negligible mass. 
The total mass of the yo-yo is <i>M</i>. A
light string is coiled around the central spindle; we shall assume that
its thickness is sufficiently small that winding or unwinding has no
effect on the effective radius of the spindle. The moment of inertia of the yo-yo
about an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to the screen
is \(I_{cm}\). 
</p>
<p>In figures 1 and 2 the yo-yo is placed
upright on a horizontal and frictionless surface, gravity is parallel to the screen pointing down.
 In figure 3, the yo-yo is placed flat
on the surface, gravity is into the screen. The string is pulled with a constant
force of magnitude <i>T</i> with the direction shown in the figures. 
</p>

</p>
<p>For each of the three situations, What is the magnitude and the direction of the center 
of mass acceleration and
the angular acceleration? Consider the +x axis to be in the direction of the tension.</p>

<b>Center of mass acceleration:</b> <br/>
 
 Is the same for the three cases. Its magnitude is  \(T/M\), and its direction is along the +x axis.
</p>
<p><b>Angular acceleration:</b><br/>
The magnitude is the same for the three cases and equal to \(bT/I_{cm}\). <br/>
The direction is  out of the screen,
counter-clockwise rotation, for cases 1 and 3, and is into the screen, clockwise rotation, for case 2.

<p>The forces acting on the yo-yo are shown in the following force diagram:</p> 
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit10/Module1/files/IE_yoyo1_sol.png"/></p>

<p><b>Dynamics and net force:</b><br/><br/>
 \(\sum\vec{F}^{ext}=M\vec{a}_{cm}\)</p>
<p>Consistent with the coordinate system in the figure,  the above equation along the x-axis implies: <br/><br/>
\(T=Ma_{cm}\) <br/><br/>
\(\vec{a}_{cm}=T/M \hat{x}\)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (eq. 1)</p>

<p><b>Rotational Dynamics and net torque:</b> <br/>
We will apply the torque equation about the yo-yo's center of mass:<br/><br/>
 \(\sum\vec{\tau}_{cm}^{ext}=I_{cm}\vec{\alpha}\)<br/><br/>
Only the force of tension does torque about the center of mass, the normal and gravitational
 forces do not do torque about the center of mass because they have zero moment arm. Therefore, 
the above equation becomes:</p>

<p>
 \(bT\hat{z}=I_{cm}\vec{\alpha} \)</p>
 <p> After  applying the right hand rule we obtain that the torque due to tension
is pointing out of the screen, along the +z-axis. Hence, the angular acceleration is also 
pointing out of the screen:</p>
<p>
 \( \vec{\alpha}=bT/I_{cm} \hat{z}\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (eq. 2)
 </p>

<p><b>REMARK:</b>  Relationship between center of mass acceleration and angular acceleration.</p>
<p>Let \(a_{cm}\) be the component of the center of mass acceleration vector along the x-axis and,
 let \(\alpha\) be the component of the angular acceleration vector along 
the axis of rotation. Using these definitions, the center of mass acceleration vector is
given by: &nbsp;&nbsp; \(\vec{a}_{cm}=a_{cm}\hat{x}\),and the angular acceleration vector 
by: &nbsp;&nbsp;
   \(\vec{\alpha}=\alpha\hat{z}\).
<br/>
<br/>
From (eq. 1) and (eq. 2) we obtain that the components of the center of mass and angular 
acceleration vectors are:<br/><br/>
\(a_{cm}=T/M \) and \(\alpha = bT/I_{cm}\)
<br/>
<br/>
After combining the above equations the relationship between the components of the center of mass
and the angular  acceleration vectors is expressed as:
<br/>
<br/>     
\(a_{cm}=\frac{I_{cm}}{bM}\alpha\)

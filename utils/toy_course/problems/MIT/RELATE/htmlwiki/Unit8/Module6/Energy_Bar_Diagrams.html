<h2>Energy Diagrams</h2>
<p>Mechanical Energy is a scalar quantity (just a number that can be positive or negative). The Mechanical Energy of a system can be augmented or decreased by forces that do non-conservative work, e.g. any outside force, or a non-conservative internal force like friction or chemical reactions. Mechanical energy can be converted between potential and kinetic by conservative interactions internal to the system.</p>
<p>All of these considerations are embodied in the general formula,</p>
<p><br/>\(E^{mech}_{f} = K_f + U_f = K_i + U_i + W^{NC}_{f,i}\)</p>
<p>In cases where the non-conservative work, \(W_{f,i}^{NC}\), is zero, the mechanical energy of the system will not change. Rather than saying that  "mechanical energy is constant", people will often say just "energy is conserved" instead.</p>

<h3> Energy Bars</h3>
<p>A simple way to visualize the above formula for the change of mechanical energy from an initial state to a final state is with energy bars, one for the final state and another for the initial state including \(W^{NC}_{f,i}\). Each bar consists of several segments stacked up vertically representing one of the terms in the equation. The total length of the stacked segments is the sum of the terms and hence is the total mechanical energy with the addition of the work (which could be negative).</p>

<p>The above figure is an example: on the left we show a case where the mechanical energy changes due to non-conservative work. On the right, energy is conserved because there is no external work nor internal non-conservative work, so the only possible processes involve internal conservative work that shift mechanical energy between kinetic and potential. In both cases, the total (or final on the left) energy does not change.</p>

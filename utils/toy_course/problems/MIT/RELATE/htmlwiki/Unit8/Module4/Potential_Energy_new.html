<h2>Potential Energy</h2>

<p>
Do work on a mass, and you will increase its Kinetic energy.  Conversely, if you try to hold back a moving mass, it will do work on you and its Kinetic energy will decrease. Thus Kinetic energy represents the immediate ability of a system to do work on the external world. It measures the energy of motion – either translational or rotational.  
</p>
<p>
In contrast, Potential energy is a static concept. It represents the potential or possibility for a system, even though it is not moving, to go into motion and then do work on the world. After releasing a compressed spring it does work on the objects attached to its ends. Potential energy depends on position, not velocity. In order to transform potential energy into work or kinetic energy, some part of the system must move.  
</p>
<p>
In general, potential energy is a function of the relative position of two objects such as the earth and a satellite, the two ends of a spring, or the height of an object in a gravitational field. In contrast, kinetic energy generally depends on velocity or angular velocity.
</p>

<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
	<p>After completing this module you should be able to:</p>
<p><ul>	
	<li>Calculate the potential energy due to gravitational (uniform and universal) and elastic forces.</li>
	<li>Define a Conservative Force</li>
	<li>Explain why in a conservative interaction there is transfer between kinetic and potential energy within the system of the interacting objects.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3> Potential Energy: Definition in terms of Force</h3>
<p>
Interactions change motion.  Up to now, we have accounted for this by </p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Finding the forces on each of the interacting objects.</li>
<li>Considering the changes in velocity or momentum that these forces produce.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Potential energy represents an alternate way to take interactions into account – a way that is simpler mathematically and (as it turns out in later branches of physics) often more fundamental.  This route involves a new core model – Mechanical Energy and Non-conservative Work which we shall introduce shortly in this unit.
</p>
<p>
But first, we have to define the Potential energy and discuss how to find it for a particular interaction.  Not surprisingly, Potential energy is defined in terms of the force associated with the interaction that it represents. The letter \(U\) is used to represent the Potential energy. For a given force \(\vec{F}\), the potential energy associated to this force is given by:
</p>
<p>\(U(\vec{r}) = - \int_{\vec{r}_{ref}}^{\vec{r}}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}\)</p>

<p>Basically, the potential energy is the path integral of the force, and the arbitrary constant from the integration is accounted for by the specification that the potential is zero at a given reference point in space that we have indicated as \(\vec{r}_{ref}\):<br/><br/>
 \(U(\vec{r}_{ref}) = 0 \) at \(\vec{r}=\vec{r}_{ref}\)</p>
 
<p><b>Potential Energy and Work:</b> <br/>
You should by now be sufficiently familiar with the definition of work to realize that the potential energy is the negative work done by the force, i.e. <br/><br/>
\(U(\vec{r})=-W_{r,r_{ref}}\)
</p>

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT POINT:</b> </p>
<p>

The concept of Potential energy makes <i>no sense</i> unless the work done by the force is the same <i>whatever the path taken by the system</i> to go from \(\vec{r}_{ref}\) to \(\vec{r}\). For example, it is not possible to associate a Potential energy to a force that depends on the direction of motion like the force of kinetic friction. As we we will show in the example in the box below, the path integral of the force of friction between two points will not be uniquely defined.</p>

<p> Consider an object sliding along a horizontal surface. The top view of the surface is shown in the figure. The object is moving from the initial position, \(\vec{r}_{ref}\), to the final position, \(\vec{r}\), following two paths:</p>
<p><i>Path 1</i>: a horizontal straight line of length 2\(a\),</p>
<p><i>Path 2:</i> a semicircular path of radius \(a\).</p>
<p>The force of friction, \(\vec{f}\), is opposite to the object's motion as shown.
</p><p>

</p>

<p>The work done by friction along path 1 is given by:</p>
<p>
\(W_{path 1}=\int_{\vec{r}_{ref}}^{\vec{r}}\vec{f}\cdot d\vec{r} =\int_0^{2a}fdx\cos(180^o)=-f2a\)</p>
<p>where we have used the fact that the magnitude of the force of friction is constant so <i>f</i> can come out of the integral.</p>
<p>The work done by friction along path 2 is:</p>
<p>\(W_{path 2}=\int_{\vec{r}_{ref}}^{\vec{r}}\vec{f}\cdot d\vec{r} =\int_0^{\pi}fad\theta\cos(180^o)=-f\pi a\)</p>
<p>We can see that \(W_{path1}\neq W_{path2}\). The path integrals differ by a factor of \(\pi/2\).</p>

<p> Another example is a force that depends on the velocity (as a drag force due to motion through air or water would) then the Potential energy is not uniquely defined.</p>
<p>  In general, interactions for which no potential energy can be defined are called <b>non-conservative</b>. Only those forces for which the integral is independent of the path may be represented by a potential energy. These forces are called <b>conservative</b>.</p>

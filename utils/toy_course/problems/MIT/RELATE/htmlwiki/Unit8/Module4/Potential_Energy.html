<h2>Potential Energy</h2>
	<p>Whereas kinetic energy has the obvious ability to do immediate work (push with a force over a distance), potential energy is the potential ability of a system to do work. <i>Potential energy</i> is a static concept &mdash; it depends on position. In order to transform potential energy into work or kinetic energy, some part of the system must move.</p>
	<p>The sum of kinetic and potential energies of a system is its total mechanical energy. Interactions that can transform energy between kinetic energy and potential energy without loss (e.g. to heat) are called <b>conservative</b>. They generate forces that are called <b>conservative forces</b>.</p>
	<p>In general, potential energy is a function of the relative position of two objects such as the earth and a satellite, the two ends of a spring, or even the height of an object in a gravitational field. In contrast, kinetic energy generally depends on velocity or angular velocity only.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
	<p>After completing this module you should be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style:disc outside none">
	<li>Define a Conservative Force</li>
	<li>Calculate the potential energy due to gravitational and elastic forces.</li>
	<li>Explain why in a conservative interaction there is transfer between kinetic and potential energy within the system of the interacting objects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Potential Energy and Force</h3>
	<p>The potential energy that represents an interaction is defined in terms of the force due to that interaction (but only if the force is conservative):</p>
	  <p>\(U(x) = - \int _{x_{ref}} ^{x} F_x(x)dx\) for a one dimensional force</p>
	<p>This force may be determined from the potential by taking the derivative:</p>
	  <p>\(F(x)= -\frac{dU}{dx} \bigg|_x\)</p>
	<p>Basically, the potential energy is an integral of the force, and the arbitrary constant from the integration is accounted for by the specification that the potential is zero at the point \(x_{ref}\).</p>
	<p>You should by now be sufficiently familiar with the definition of work to realize that the potential energy is the work done by a conservative force, i.e. \(U(x) = -W_{x,x_{ref}}\)</p>
	<p>This expression may give you some intuition about the potential, which we extend by calculating the potential from the work integrals for several common conservative forces in the next section.</p>
	<p>The potential energy gives us a way to account for the effects of a conservative interaction that does not require us to calculate the work from the corresponding interaction. <b>Warning:</b> This implies that a particular interaction must be incorporated in your mathematical description <b>either</b> as a potential energy OR as a force that does work, but not both ways simultaneously.</p>

			<p>If the force exists in two (or more) dimensional space, then the potential energy is defined in that space. The corresponding (multi-dimensional) definition is:</p>
			  <p>\(U(\vec{r}) = - \int_{\vec{r}_{ref}} ^{\vec{r}} F_{\vec{r}}(\vec{r}) d\vec{r}\)</p>
			<p>The force is now a vector, and is determined as follows:</p>
			  <p>\(F(\vec{r}) = -\nabla U(\vec{R})\) where \(\nabla\) is the gradient operator, hence</p>
			  <p>\(F(\vec{r}) = F_x(x,y,z) \hat{x} + F_y(x,y,z) \hat{y} + F_z(x,y,z) \hat{z} = \frac{\partial U}{\partial x} \hat{x} + \cdots\)</p>
			<p>Here \(\partial U/\partial x\) is the partial derivative of U with repsect to x, which is simply the usual derivative of U with respect to x while holding y and z constant</p>

				<td><p>Holding the other variables constant is important when you might be tempted to try some procedure involving both x and y derivatives if you know that your particle is confined to move on a track at an angle to the x and y axes. The correct procedure would be to find the force as above and then take the dot product of the force with the direction of motion. The concept of partial derivatives becomes very important in thermodynamics, where physical quantities like the entropy of a gas might be functions of several different physical quantities &mdash; for example the temperature, the interactions within the gas, the volume of the container, etc.</p>

<h3>Conservatives forces in introductory mechanics </h3>
<p>
	In the example above we have shown that work done by the gravitational force near the Earth's surface is independent of the path followed by the object. It depends only on the initial and final position (actually just the heights).</p>
<p>
	The same result can be shown for the gravitational force far from the Earth's surface and also for the elastic force of a spring.</p>

<h3>Potential Energy Expressions</h3>
	<p>In this section we'll find expressions for the potential energies of the three most common conservative interactions in introductory mechanics: uniform gravity (near-earth gravity), universal gravity, and springs. The definition of potential energy allows it to be calculated from the spatial behavior of the associated force.</p>
<table style="color:teal">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
	When a force is <b>conservative</b> the negative of the work done by the force between two points is defined as the change in <b> potential energy </b> between those two points.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We'll exploit this expression to calculate potential energy in terms of the work since we've already presented a number of explicit work calculations and you should have some intuition about work.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that while the potential energy shifts by an arbitrary constant depending on the choice of the reference point where the potential is taken to be zero, this has no physical implications. The fundamental energy relationship always involves the potential energy at both the initial and final states of the system. Hence only a difference of potential energies can have physical significance. And this difference just boils down to the work done by the interaction when a particle moves (by whatever path) between initial and final states.</p>
<p>
	Potential energy is denoted by the letter <i>U</i>, and the change in potential energy between an initial to a final point is given (in 1 dimension) by:</p>
<p>
\(U(x_f) - U(x_i)= - \int_{x_{ref}} ^{x_f} F_x(x)dx + \int_{x_{ref}} ^{x_i} F_x(x)dx = - \int_{x_i} ^{x_f} F_x(x)dx = - W_{f,i}\)</p>
<br/>
			where \(x_i\) and \(x_f\) are the initial and final positions.</p>

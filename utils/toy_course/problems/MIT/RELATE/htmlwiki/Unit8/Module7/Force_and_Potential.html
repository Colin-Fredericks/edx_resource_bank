<h2>Force and Potential Energy</h2>

<h3> Potential Energy from Force: definition</h3>
<p>For a one dimensional conservative force, we define the potential energy as: \(U(x) = - \int_{x_{ref}}^{x} F(x')\; dx'\)</p>
<p>The choice of reference point changes the value of U(x), but does not change the value of observable quantities when observables are calculated using the potential energy, it is only the difference between the potential at two different points (e.g. initial and final as in the equation above) that has observable effects. Another view of the zero point is that the potential at a particular point is defined as an indefinite integral whose upper limit is that point. Since integration is uncertain by an additive constant, and the reference point basically determines that constant by replacing the indefinite integral by a definite integral (that does not have any uncertainty).</p>
<p>In this course, we will mostly deal with the following conservative forces. It is helpful to do the integrals in advance and have the form of the potential energy ready to use in problems. The following table is a summary of these forces and their potential energies:</p>

<h3> Force from Potential Energy</h3>
<p>What if you know the potential energy, but not the force in terms of which it was derived?  Given that the potential energy is negative the integral of the force, it should be clear that</p>
<p>\[F(x) = -\frac{dU}{dx}\]</p>
<p>i.e. the force is the negative of the derivative of the potential energy with respect to position.</p>
<p>For example, if the potential increases with increasing x, then the force is in the negative x direction. This makes sense: as the particle moves to the right, its potential energy will increase &mdash; therefore, since energy is conserved, it's kinetic energy will decrease which can only happen if the force opposes the direction of motion.</p>
<p>If you think of a graph of the potential energy (note elastic potential energy below) vs. position as the height above ground of a frictionless track (e.g. of a roller coaster), then it's clear that an upward sloping track will push the particle to the left (due to the normal force).</p>
<p><br/><img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit8/Module7/files/ElasPot.png"/></p>
<p>A particle to the right of the origin feels a force back toward the origin - i.e. a restoring force. In fact, it is proportional to the negative of the displacement because the curve is a parabola and \(F_x(x) = - \frac{dU}{dx} = -kx\).</p>
<h3>Three dimensional forces</h3>
<p> If the conservative force is not one dimensional then the relationship between the force and the associated 
potential energy is shown in the box below.</p>
	<table class="subtable collapsible collapsed">
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
		<th>Potential Energy in several dimensions
		  [<a href="javascript:toggleDisplay('ht01','hide','show')" id="ht01l">show</a>]</th></tr>
	  <tr style="display:none" id="ht01">
		<td>
			<p>If the force exists in two (or more) dimensional space, then the potential energy is defined in that space. The corresponding (multi-dimensional) definition is:</p>
			  <p>\(U(\vec{r}) = - \int_{\vec{r}_{ref}} ^{\vec{r}} F_{\vec{r}}(\vec{r}) d\vec{r}\)</p>
			<p>The force is now a vector, and is determined as follows:</p>
			  <p>\(F(\vec{r}) = -\nabla U(\vec{r})\) where \(\nabla\) is the gradient operator, hence</p>
			  <p>\(F(\vec{r}) = F_x(x,y,z) \hat{x} + F_y(x,y,z) \hat{y} + F_z(x,y,z) \hat{z} = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} \hat{x} -\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} \hat{y}-\frac{\partial U}{\partial z} \hat{z}\)</p>
			<p>Here \(\partial U/\partial x\) is the partial derivative of U with repsect to x, which is simply the usual derivative of U with respect to x while holding y and z constant</p>

				[<a href="javascript:toggleDisplay('ht02','hide','show')" id="ht02l">show</a>]</th></tr>
			  <tr style="display:none" id="ht02">
				<td><p>Holding the other variables constant is important when you might be tempted to try some procedure involving both x and y derivatives if you know that your particle is confined to move on a track at an angle to the x and y axes. The correct procedure would be to find the force as above and then take the dot product of the force with the direction of motion. The concept of partial derivatives becomes very important in thermodynamics, where physical quantities like the entropy of a gas might be functions of several different physical quantities &mdash; for example the temperature, the interactions within the gas, the volume of the container, etc.</p>

<h3> Finding Which Models Apply to a Problem</h3>

<p>Determining which of the core models applies to a particular physical problem is facilitated by specifying the system and the interactions present in that problem.  Then match the system and interaction with the unique one of the four models that are distinguished solely on the basis of the nature of their applicable systems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>whether they involve translation of particles (two blue models on left) or rotation of rigid bodies (two red models on right), and</li>
	<li>whether the applicable system is a single particle or single rigid body (left model in blue or red) or a system of these objects (right model in blue or red).</li>
	<li>The fifth major model - Mechanical Energy and Non-conservative Work - can apply to any type of system. It is appropriately in the middle since it involves both translational and rotational motion. It can involve multiple objects that may be either particles or rigid bodies. The agent of change for this model is non-conservative work, and so learning to recognize situations where there is non-conservative work is a key to using this model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that whether the interactions manifest as forces or torques is uniquely associated with whether the system is composed of particles or rigid bodies.</p>

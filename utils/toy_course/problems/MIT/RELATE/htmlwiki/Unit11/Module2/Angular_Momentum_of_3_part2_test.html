<h2> Spin Angular Momentum of Planar Objects</h2>
<p>We will now discuss the angular momentum of planar objects that rotate about a fixed axis
 perpendicular to the plane in which they are contained. As shown in the figures below, the two 
 possible cases are: the axis of rotation passes through the center of mass of the object, or it 
 does not (but it intersects the object 
 at a given point - point <b><font size="4">Q</font></b>  in the right figure).
 <!--
 <b>With one exception, we’ll restrict attention to finding 
 the angular momentum about a point in that plane.  For this case: <b>the objects, their motion,
  and their displacements from the reference point to objects all lie in one plane</b>
   (usually the x-y plane).

 <b>1.<u> Rotation about an axis passing through the center of mass</u>:</b>
 </p>
 <p>
When the axis of rotation passes through the center of mass
and is perpendicular to the plane of rotation (the x-y plane in the figure), 
the angular momentum measured from a point <i><b>S</b></i> in the axis is given by:
<br/>
<br/>
\(\vec{L}_S=I_{cm} \vec{\omega}\)<br/>
<br/>
where  \(I_{cm}\) is the moment of inertia
of the object about the axis passing through its center of mass. In addition, the expression 
above is the same for ANY point  
 <i><b>S</b></i> along the axis. The angular momentum is parallel 
to the angular velocity vector and it is independent of the location of the point <i><b>S</b></i>,
as long as <i><b>S</b></i> is on the axis of rotation.

<p>Consider the same rigid object as the one in the previous page but now the axis of rotation is passing through 
the center of mass of the object.</p>
<p> As shown in the figure, the object consists of two small balls of masses <i><b>m<sub>1</sub></b></i> 
and <i><b>m<sub>2</sub></b></i>,  <i><b>m<sub>2</sub></b></i> > <i><b>m<sub>1</sub></b></i>, connected 
by a rod of negligible mass. The object is placed on a horizontal and frictionless table contained 
in the x-y plane ans it is set to rotate counterclockwise as viewed from above 
the x-y plane with an angular speed <i><b>&omega;</b></i>. Therefore, the axis of rotation is 
perpendicular to the plane of rotation and is  passing through the <u>center of mass</u> of the object.  The distance between 
particle 1 and the center of mass is \(d_1\) and the distance between 2 and the center of mass is \(d_2\).</p>
<p>
 Consider now the point <b>S</b>  
 located in the axis of rotation at a distance <i>d</i> below the center of mass. </p>

<p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit11/Module2/files/2ballsBar_new_part2.png"/></p>
 <p>
 We will show that the angular momentum about any point along the axis of
 rotation is parallel to the angular velocity vector and it is independent of the location of the point.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before starting with the proof,
 note that the position of the center of mass measured from point
 <b>S</b> is given by:</p>
 <p>\(\vec{R}_{cm,S}=(m_1\vec{r}_1+m_2\vec{r}_2)/(m_1+m_2)\)</p>
 <p>where \(\vec{r}_1\) and \(\vec{r}_2\) are the position vectors of particles 1 and 2
 measured from point <b>S</b> as shown below.</p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit11/Module2/files/2ballsBar_new_part2_cm.png"/></p>
 <p>Writing the position vectors in terms of \(d_1\), \(d_2\) and \(d\), we have that at the instant
 when the rod is along the y-axis:</p>
 <p>\(\vec{R}_{cm,S}=(m_1(-d_1\hat{y}+d\hat{z})+m_2(d_2\hat{y}+d\hat{z}))/(m_1+m_2)\)</p>
 rearranging terms,
 <p>\(\vec{R}_{cm,S}=((-m_1d_1+ m_2d_2)\hat{y}+(m_1+m_2)d\;\hat{z})/(m_1+m_2)\) &nbsp;&nbsp; (eq. 1)</p>
 <p>Because the point <b>S</b> is below the center of mass and both points, <b>S</b> and <i>cm</i>, 
  are in the z-axis, then the position of the center of mass measured from  point <b>S</b>  does
  not have a component on the xy-plane and is given by:</p>
 <p>\(\vec{R}_{cm,S}=d\;\hat{z}\)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (eq. 2)</p>
<p>Because (eq. 1) = (eq. 2), then </p>
<p> \(-m_1d_1+m_2d_2 = 0\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (eq. 3)</p>
<p> We will use the relationship in (eq. 3) in our proof.</p>

<p>Now we calculate the angular momentum of the object as the sum of the angular momentum of the particles. 
(The rod does not 
contribute to the object's angular momentum because it has negligible mass).</p>
<p>\(\vec{L}_S=\vec{L}_S^1+\vec{L}_S^2\)</p>
<p>If \(\vec{v}_1\) and \(\vec{v}_2\) are the velocities of particles 1 and 2, then:</p>
<p>\(\vec{L}_S^1=m_1\vec{r}_1\times\vec{v}_1\)</p>
<p>\(\vec{L}_S^2=m_1\vec{r}_2\times\vec{v}_2\)</p>
<p>The angular momentum of each particle is perpendicular to the position and the velocity vectors:</p>
<p>\(\vec{L}_S^1 \perp \vec{r}_1\) and \(\vec{L}_S^1 \perp \vec{v}_1\)</p>
<p>\(\vec{L}_S^2 \perp \vec{r}_2\) and \(\vec{L}_S^2 \perp \vec{v}_2\)</p>
<p>As a result, the angular momentum of each particle about point <b>S</b> is not parallel
to the angular velocity vector \(\vec{\omega}\) as shown below. </p>
<p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit11/Module2/files/2ballsBar_new_part2_L.png"/>
</p>
<p>However, the total angular momentum is parallel to \(\vec{\omega}\). In order to prove this statement, we
will add vectorially  \(\vec{L}_S^1\) and \(\vec{L}_S^2\) by decomposing the angular momentum 
vectors along the xy-plane and along the z-axis.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we will do that at the instant when the rod is along the y-axis as shown in the left of the figure below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<img src="/static/problems/MIT/RELATE/htmlwiki/Unit11/Module2/files/2ballsBar_new_part2_L_xy.png"/></p>

<p>The components along the xy-plane:</p>
<p> \(L_{S,xy}^1=m_1r_1v_1\cos\varphi_1\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for particle 1</p>
<p> \(L_{S,xy}^2=- m_2r_2v_2\cos\varphi_2\) &nbsp;&nbsp; for particle 2</p>
<p> where \(\varphi_1\) and \(\varphi_2\) are the angles between the angular momentum vectors
and the plane,  \(v_1=\omega d_1\) and \(v_2=\omega d_2\). Adding the components on the plane:</p>
<p>\(L_{S,xy}=L_{S,xy}^1+L_{S,xy}^2= \)</p>
<p>\(L_{S,xy}= m_1r_1\omega d_1\cos\varphi_1  -m_2r_2\omega d_2\cos\varphi_2\omega\) &nbsp;&nbsp; (eq. 4)</p>
<p>From the figure, the cosines are given by:</p>
<p>\(\cos\varphi_1=d/r_1\) &nbsp; and \(\cos\varphi_2=d/r_2\)</p>
<p> then  \(\cos\varphi_1 r_1 = d\) and 
 \(\cos\varphi_2 r_2 = d\). Replacing these relationships in (eq. 4) and taking \(d\) and \(\omega\) as common factors
 we obtain:</p>
<p>\(L_{S,xy}= (m_1d_1-m_2d_1)d\omega\)</p>
<p>Note that the term in the parenthesis is zero according to (eq. 3), therefore the component 
of the total angular momentum along the plane of rotation is zero and the total angular momentum is along the z-axis, 
parallel 
to \(\vec\omega\) as we wanted to prove:</p>
<p>\(\vec{L}_S=\vec{L}_S^1+\vec{L}_S^2 = (L_{S,z}^1+L_{S,z}^2)\hat{z}\)</p>

<p> We now calculate the value of the z--components:</p>
<p>\(L_{S,z}^1=m_1r_1v_1\sin\varphi_1\) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for particle 1</p>
<p> \(L_{S,z}^2=- m_2r_2v_2\sin\varphi_2\) &nbsp;&nbsp; for particle 2</p>
<p>Adding the z-components:</p>
<p>\(L_{S,z}=L_{S,z}^1+L_{S,z}^2\)</p>
<p>\(L_{S,z} = m_1r_1v_1\sin\varphi_1 + m_2r_2v_2\sin\varphi_2\)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (eq. 5)</p>
<p> where the sines are given by \(\sin\varphi_1=d_1/r_1\) &nbsp; and &nbsp;\(\sin\varphi_2=d_2/r_2\) &nbsp; then 
&nbsp; \(\sin\varphi_1 r_1=d_1\) &nbsp; and \(\sin\varphi_2 r_2=d_2\). Replacing these relationships in 
(eq. 5) we obtain:</p>
 <p>\(L_{S,z} = m_1v_1d_1+m_2v_2d_2\)</p>
 <p>Using that \(v_1=\omega d_1\)  and \(v_2=\omega d_2\) in the above expression:</p>
 <p>\(L_{S,z} = (m_1d_1^2+m_2d_2^2)\omega \)</p>
 <p>The term inside the parenthesis is the moment of inertia of the object about the center of mass, \(I_{cm}\). 
Note that this expression is independent
 of \(d\), the location of the point <b>S</b> in the axis. </p>
 <p><b>Summary:</b></p>
 
 <p>We have shown, for this particular planar object, that for an axis perpendicular to the plane
  of rotation and passing through the center of mass, the angular momentum about any point <b>S</b>
 along the axis is parallel to \(\vec{\omega}\) and independent of the location of the point
 <b>S</b>:</p>
 <p>\(\vec{L}_S = I_{cm}\vec{\omega}\)</p>
 <p>This result can be generalized to any planar rigid object as long as it rotates about an axis perpendicular to the 
 plane of rotation and passing through the object's center of mass. If the object is formed by a continuous mass 
 distribution, then \(I_{cm}\) is not a sum but an integral. </p>
 <p><b>Note:</b> The moment of inertia of the objects that we use
 in this course can be found in a table. Therefore, there is not need to calculate the integrals (they  have already
 been calculated for us). We can focus directly in the physics of the problems.

<p><b>Summary???????<b></p>
<p>
1. For all cases, the angular momentum is taken about a point in the plane of motion, and

 momentum about an axis passing through this point in the plane.  Additionally, the angular 
 momentum is always given by
</p>
<p>\(\vec{L}_{axis}=I_{axis}\vec{\omega}\)</p>
<p>
2. When a planar object is rotating about an axis through its center of mass, its angular 
momentum about any point in the plane axis is equal to the angular momentum of the object 
about its center of mass.  (Be sure you understand that the angular momentum can be 
calculated about any point, not necessarily the point about which it is rotating.)

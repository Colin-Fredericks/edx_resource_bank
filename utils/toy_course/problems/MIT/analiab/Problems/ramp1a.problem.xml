      <p>
A person wants to move a file cabinet of mass m up an incline of angle \(\alpha\) with respect to the horizontal. There is 
friction between the cabinet and the surface (\(\mu_s\), \(\mu_k\)).  
</p><br/>
<b>Part a.</b> When the person applies a force parallel to the incline surface of magnitude F , the box does not move. Which of 
the following statements are correct?

<b>Feedback:</b><br/>               
The force of static friction will depend on the magnitude of the applied force, <i><b>F</b></i>, and on the component of 
the cabinet's weight along the surface, <i>mgsin&#945;</i>. The force of static friction is a <b>constraint force</b> as it keeps
 the cabinet at rest by changing its magnitude and direction according to Newton's second law (<b>&#931;<i>F</i> = 0</b>).
<ul><li> If <i><b>F</b> &gt; mgsin&#945;</i>, the force of static friction must be directed downhill, otherwise the cabinet 
will move up.</li><li> If <i><b>F</b> = mgsin&#945;</i>, no force of friction is needed to keep the cabinet at rest.</li><li> 
If <i><b>F</b> &lt; mgsin&#945;</i>, the force of friction must be pointed uphill, otherwise the cabinet will slide down.
</li></ul>

      <p>
A baseball of length D and mass M rests on a horizontal and frictionless surface. The moment of inertia of the bat about its center of mass is <i>I</i> and the 
distance between the handle end to the batâ€™s center of mass is d. The bat is struck by a baseball travelling perpendicular to the bat. The impact applies 
a force F during a time interval \(\Delta t = t_f-t_i\). As shown in the figure, the force is applied at a distance x from the handle end of the bat.
 What must be x so that the handle end remains at rest when the bat starts to move?

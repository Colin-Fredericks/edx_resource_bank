tension="m*g*sqrt(1+d^4/(2*R*h)^2) "

      <p>
A bob of mass m is suspended from a fixed point with a massless string (i.e., it is a pendulum). The bob describes a circular 
and horizontal path of radius R. The circle is at a height h from the ground. Right after the instant shown in the picture the 
string breaks and the bob lands at a distance d from the position where the string broke. What is the magnitude of the force of tension
 of the string at that instant?

<i>In your solution clearly indicate</i>:
<br/>
<p><i>The <b>system(s)</b> that you consider and the <b>interactions</b> between the object(s) in the system and external objects. 
Draw the resulting forces in a FBD. Indicate the coordinate system that you will use to describe the vectors. Indicate in your solutions
the <b>model(s)</b> that you use.

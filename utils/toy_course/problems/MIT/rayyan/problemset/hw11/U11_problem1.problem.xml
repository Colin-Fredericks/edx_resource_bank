<p>An object of mass m is suspended from a spring that has spring constant k and whose other end is attached to the ceiling. Let y0 be the equilibrium position of the object in the absence of gravity, and y1 the equilibrium position of the object under the influence of gravity, both measured from the ceiling.</p>

<p>A cylinder of mass \(M\) and radius \(R\) is free to rotate around a frictionless axle through its center. The axle is connected to a spring of spring constant \(k\). The surface of the floor is rough enough that the cylinder always rolls without slipping. The spring is displaced a distance \(x_0\) from the springs unstretched position, and then released. The cylinder starts rolling back and forth.</p>

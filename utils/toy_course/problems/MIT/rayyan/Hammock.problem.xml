      <p>
Your friend of mass m sits in a hammock that is suspended between two vertical posts separated by a distance d. If the hammock dips a distance h below the height l at which the hammock is secured to the posts, what is the horizontal force on each post due to your friend? Use g for the gravitational constant.

            <p>Did you mean ".../(4*h)" not "/4h" or "/4*h"? Check your response.</p>

        <p><b>Great!</b> You can now see the solution. Reflect on what would happen if h were very, very small.<hr/> </p>

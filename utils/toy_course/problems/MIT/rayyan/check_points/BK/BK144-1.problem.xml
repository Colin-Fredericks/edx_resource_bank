      <p>A system consists of two blocks, of masses m and 2m, attached to the ends of a spring with a force constant k. The system is placed on a horizontal frictionless surface. The blocks then are pulled an "extra" distance x apart and simultaneously released from the state of rest. During the subsequent motion of the blocks, what is the maximum speed of block m? </p>

<p>Part 1. Which concepts are most useful in solving this problem? </p>

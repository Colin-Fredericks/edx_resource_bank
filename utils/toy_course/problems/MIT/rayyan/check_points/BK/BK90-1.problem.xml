    <title> CheckPoint: Yo-Yo </title>


      <p>A yo-yo has an external radius <i>R</i> and an internal radius <i>r</i>. The mass 
      of the yo-yo is <i>m</i> and its moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the screen
      and passing through its
       center of mass is <i>I</i>. The yo-yo is being pulled 
       horizontally by a moderate force of magnitude <i>F</i> applied to a light string wrapped around 
       the inner shaft as shown. The yo-yo rolls along a horizontal surface without slipping,
       at low values of <i>F</i>, as shown in the diagram. </p>

<p>If the magnitude of the force of friction has a magnitude \(F_f\), and the acceleration 
of the center of mass has a magnitude <i>a</i>, what is the correct expression for
 Newton's 2nd law for the yo-yo? (assume right to be positive)</p>

	  <p>Part 4. (Same question as part 3) Now suppose there is friction between  \(M_{1}\) and the inclined plane. The system is held at rest and then released. Which of the following statements are true?</p>
        <optionresponse texlayout="horizontal" randomize="no">
          <ul>
            <li>
                <p>For block \(M_{1}\), the change in its kinetic energy is equal and opposite to the change in its potential energy</p>

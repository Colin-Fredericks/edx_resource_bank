<p>A solid sphere of mass m = $m kg and radius r = $r m is spinning about the axis passing through the center of the sphere. At t = 0, the angular speed of the sphere is \(\omega_{0}\) = $o rad/s and the sphere rotates clockwise. At t = 4.0 s, the angular speed is \(\omega \) = $w rad/s and the sphere rotates counterclockwise.</p>

<br/>
<p>Part A. What is the magnitude of the angular impulse about the center of mass applied to the sphere between t = 0 and t = 4.0 s? Enter the answer in [N.m.s].</p>

<p>Part B. Assuming that the torque about the center of mass applied to the sphere is constant between t = 0 and t = 4.0 s, what is the magnitude of that torque?</p>

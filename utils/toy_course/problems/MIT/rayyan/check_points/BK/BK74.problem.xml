    <p>A small block of mass $m kg is launched by a compressed spring with force constant k=$k N/m. The initial compression of the spring is $x m. The block slides along a horizontal frictionless surface and then up an inclined plane that makes an angle \(\theta = $theta^{\circ}\) with the horizontal. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the inclined plane is \(\mu_k = $mu\). Use \( g = 9.8 m/s^2 \).</p>
	<p>Find the maximum vertical height h reached by the block.</p>

    <title> CheckPoint: Yo-Yo - Part 1</title>

<p>A yo-yo has mass <i>m</i> and a moment of inertia \(I\) measured with respect
to an axis perpendicular to the screen and passing through its center of mass. A light 
thin string is wrapped around the central part of the yo-yo that has radius \(r\). The 
string is attached to the ceiling as shown. The yo-yo is released from rest and begins to 
descend as the string unwraps. The coordinate system used is shown in the diagram.</p>

<br/>

<p>If the force of tension in the string has a magnitude <i> T</i>, and the acceleration
of the center of mass has a magnitude <i>a</i>, what is the correct 
expression that results from applying Newton's 2nd law on the motion of the center of mass
 of the yo-yo? </p>

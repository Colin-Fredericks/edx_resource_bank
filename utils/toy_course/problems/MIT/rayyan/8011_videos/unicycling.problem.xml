As described in the video, the three forces primarily involved with unicycling are gravity, a normal force, and friction. In order to turn, a unicyclist (or a biker) may try a technique called countersteering. Which of the following offers a correct explanation for the process of by which a unicyclist can countersteer to make a turn?

<p>Explanation: countersteering involves steering in the opposite direction to begin a turn. This moves the wheel, leaving the unicyclist leaning to the inside of the turn (radially inward). Friction then acts as a centripetal force, but this also causes a large torque about the center of mass (i.e. the rider). The leaning is necessary to make torque from the normal force offset the torque due to friction.</p>

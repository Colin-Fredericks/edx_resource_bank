      <p>Two cars are approaching a perpendicular intersection without a stop sign. Car 1  has a mass $m1 kg and is heading north and car 2 has mass $m2 kg and is heading west. The two cars collide at the intersection, and stick together as a result of the collision. The police report stated that after the collision, the two cars were moving in a direction \( $theta^o \) west of north. What is the ratio of the initial speed of car 1 to car 2?</p>

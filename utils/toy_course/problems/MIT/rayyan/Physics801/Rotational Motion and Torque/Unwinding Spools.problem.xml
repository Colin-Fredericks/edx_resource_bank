      <p>
Red ribbon wound around a red spool (above) is taped to blue ribbon wound around a blue spool (below). The ribbon is essentially massless, but the solid cylindrical spools each have mass m and radius R. If the red spool can freely rotate on a fixed axle and the blue spool is positioned directly underneath with the ribbon taut, what is the downward acceleration of the blue spool? Gravity is downward. <br/>
Enter your answer in terms of some or all of the variables m, R and g.

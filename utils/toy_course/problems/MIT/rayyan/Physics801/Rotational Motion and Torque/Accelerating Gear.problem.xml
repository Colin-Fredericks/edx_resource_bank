<p>Gear 1 of radius R is attached to a motor that can provide a constant torque regardless of angular velocity. Gear 2 of mass m and radius r is set at rest upon Gear 1 so that a line segment from the center of gear 1 to the center of gear 2 makes a positive angle B with the horizontal. If the gears have small groves that prevent any slipping, what must be the magnitude of the angular acceleration \( \alpha \) of gear 1 so that gear 2 will stay in the same position? (Concerning rotational inertia, treat the gears as uniform cylinders that do not slip with respect to each other.)<br/></p>

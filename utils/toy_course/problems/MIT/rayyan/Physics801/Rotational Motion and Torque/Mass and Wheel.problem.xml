<p>An engineer is in a competition to launch a pumpkin as high as possible using a launching device that
 must be kept within a certain height. Because of the height restriction, the engineer wants to 
 accelerate the pumpkin to a large speed before releasing it.</p>
<p>The engineer decides a good way to get the pumpkin moving fast is to attach the pumpkin to the edge 
of a vertical wheel turned by a motor. When the wheel is turning as fast as possible at its 
constant rate w, the pumpkin is released so that it goes straight upwards (see figure). </p>
<p>If during the 
competition the pumpkin reaches a maximum height H from where it was released, what was the angular 
velocity w of the wheel? Use g, H, and R in your answer.<br/></p>

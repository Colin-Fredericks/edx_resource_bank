<p>Two engineers are working together in a competition to launch a pumpkin as high as possible using a launching device that must be kept within a certain height. Since the engineers have a height restriction, they want to accelerate the pumpkin to a large speed before releasing it. They decide a good way to get the pumpkin moving fast is to attach the pumpkin to a vertical wheel turned by a motor.</p>
<p>The first engineer suggests that when the wheel is turning as fast as possible at its constant rate w, the pumpkin can be released so that it goes straight upwards.</p>
<p>The other engineer gets out a notebook, runs through some physics calculations, and concludes that 
releasing the pumpkin straight up will not achieve maximum height. If the wheel spins at a constant 
angular velocity w, at what angle \(\Theta\) should the pumpkin be released to reach the highest 
distance from the ground?</p>
<p>In your calculations, use the small angle aproximations for the \(\sin \Theta \) and 
\(\cos \Theta\), and assume the wheel is spinning quickly. Use g, R, and W in your answer.
 Hint: what are the necessary terms to keep in your small angle approximation?</p>

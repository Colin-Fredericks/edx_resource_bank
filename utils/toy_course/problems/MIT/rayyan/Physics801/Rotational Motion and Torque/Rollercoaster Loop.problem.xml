      <p>As an engineer for amusement park, you are asked to design a simple rollercoaster with an inversion (a loop). The rollercoaster will start from rest at a height of h, drop on a smooth track, complete a circular loop of radius r, and then continue towards the right. You want the riders' perceived weight at the top of the loop to be $n mg (also known as a g-force of $n). What must h be in terms of r? Assume there is no friction or air resistance and ignore the size of the rider relative to h.</p>

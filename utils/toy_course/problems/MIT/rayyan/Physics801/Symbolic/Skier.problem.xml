<p>An experienced skier knows how to gain speed while skiing over a small dip in the snow. The trick is to jump in the air and land smoothly on the downward slope. <br/>
Here a skier traveling at velocity v wants to jump up and smoothly land on a dip that makes an angle b with the horizontal. For what distance d back from the dip should the skier jump up into the air in order to make a smooth landing? Assume that the skis have no friction with the snow.</p>

<p>Use g for the gravitational constant.</p>

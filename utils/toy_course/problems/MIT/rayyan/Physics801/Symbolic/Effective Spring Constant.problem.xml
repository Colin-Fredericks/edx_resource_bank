      <p>Two springs with spring constants k1 and k2 are connected in parallel (A) or in series (B) as shown below. Find the effective spring constant k<sub>eff</sub> for each configuration. (The effective spring constant is k = Force<sub>applied</sub>/(Resulting Displacement).) Use k1 and k2 (not k_1 and k_2). </p>

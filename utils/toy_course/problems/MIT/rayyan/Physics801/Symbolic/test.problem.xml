xxA car is stopped at an intersection with a red light and a biker (in a bike lane) with velocity v is approaching the car. When the biker is a distance d from the intersection, the light turns green and the car begins to accelerate at a constant acceleration a. If biker just barely catches up to the car as the car accelerates, how far from the intersection will the biker just catch up to the car?
<br/>
Put your answer only using the variable d, not v and a. <br/>

      <p>A satellite of mass \(m\) is in a circular orbit around the Earth with radius \(2R_E\). The satellite hits a piece of space junk of mass \(m_j\) that sticks to it. The satellite (carrying the extra mass) then falls in an elliptical orbit around the Earth. Assume that the piece of junk had a negligible speed at the moment of the collision. What is the maximum value of the junk mass \(m_j\) if the satellite of \(m\) is to remain in orbit without hitting the Earth? Write your expression in terms of \(m\).</p>

      <p>\(m_j\)= </p>

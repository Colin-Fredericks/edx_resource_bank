        <br/>

<p>Two blocks of masses \(m\) and \(2m\) are placed on a horizontal table. The coefficient of friction (both static and kinetic) between each block and the table is \(\mu_s\). The blocks are connected by a spring with a force constant \(k\). Initially, the spring is relaxed. Then the block of mass \(m\) is given a quick push as shown. What is the minimum initial speed of that block that would make the other block move?</p>

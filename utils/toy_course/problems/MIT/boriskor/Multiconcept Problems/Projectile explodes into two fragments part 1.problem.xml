	<p>A projectile of mass \(3m\) is launched upward from the ground level. The projectile explodes at the top point of its trajectory which is a horizontal distance \(x\) from the launch point. As a result of the explosion, the projectile breaks into two fragments, of masses \(2m\) and \(m\), both initially travelling horizontally. The larger fragment ends up landing at the launch point. </p>

	<p>How far from the launch point does the smaller fragment land?</p>

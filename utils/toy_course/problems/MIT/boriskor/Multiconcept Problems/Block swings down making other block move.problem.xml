        <br/>

      <p>Two blocks, of masses \(M\) and \(m\), are connected by a light string passing over a 
      very small frictionless pulley. Initially, both of the blocks are at rest because of 
      friction between block \(M\) and the horizontal surface. Then block m is pulled sideways 
      until the string makes angle \(\theta\) with the vertical and then released. At this point, 
      the length of string between the pulley and the block is \(L\). Block \(M\) begins to slide 
      at the very moment block \(m\) passes through its original position. Find the coefficient of 
      static friction \(\mu_s\) between block M and the horizontal surface.</p>

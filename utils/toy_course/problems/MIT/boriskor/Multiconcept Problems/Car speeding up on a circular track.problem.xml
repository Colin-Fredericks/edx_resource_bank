      <p><br/>A car of mass \(m\) takes off from rest around a circular track of radius \(r\). 
      Speeding up at a constant rate, the car takes \(t\) seconds to go around the track once. 
      What is the magnitude of the <i>net</i> force \(F\) acting on the car at the end of the trip? 
      In your answer, use <b>pi</b> for \(\pi=3.1415...\)

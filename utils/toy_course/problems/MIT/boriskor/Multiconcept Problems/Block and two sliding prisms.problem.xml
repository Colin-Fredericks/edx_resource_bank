<p>Two prisms of equal masses \(m\) are placed on a horizontal surface. Each prism has a vertical height \(H\) and makes an angle \(\theta\) with the horizontal. A small block of mass \(m\) is held at rest at the top of one of the prisms. After the block is released, it slides down and then slides up the other prism. Assume that there is no friction between the prisms and the block <i>and</i> between the prisms and the horizontal surface and the blocks make a smooth transition from block to surface and back. What maximum vertical height \(h\) will be reached by the block on the second prism?</p>

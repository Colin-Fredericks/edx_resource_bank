You stand at the end of a long board of length \(L\). The board rests on a frictionless frozen surface of a pond. You want to jump to the opposite end of the board. What is the minimum take-off speed \(v\) measured with respect to the pond that would allow you to accomplish that? The board and you have the same mass \(m\).<br/>
Use g for the acceleration due to gravity.

\(v =\)

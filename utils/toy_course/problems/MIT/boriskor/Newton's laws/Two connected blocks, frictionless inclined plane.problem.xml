M_2="M_1 *sin(theta)"

      <p><br/>
In the diagram, \(M_1\) and \(\theta\) are given. The inclined plane is frictionless, and you can assume that the pulley is massless and rotates around a frictionless axel. Find the value of \(M_2\)  that would keep the system in equilibrium.
<br/>
Type  \(M_1\) and \(\theta\) as M_1 and theta respectively.
<br/>
\(M_2 =\)

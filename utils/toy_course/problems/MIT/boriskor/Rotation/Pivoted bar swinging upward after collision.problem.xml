<p>A uniform bar of mass \(M\) and length \(D\) is suspended on a frictionless hinge. A blob of clay of mass \(M\) strikes the bottom end of the bar and gets stuck to it. As a result, the bar swings upward. What is the minimum speed \(v\) of the blob of clay before impact that would enable the rod to swing over the top? (Enter g for the acceleration of gravity)</p>

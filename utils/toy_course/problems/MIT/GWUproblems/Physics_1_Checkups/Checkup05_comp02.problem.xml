      <p>A visitor to a lighthouse wishes to determine the height of the tower. She ties a spool of thread to a small rock to make a simple pendulum, which she hangs down the center of a spiral staircase of the tower. The period of oscillation is $time seconds. What is the height of the tower, assuming that the rock just misses the ground and the other end is tied near the top of the tower?</p>

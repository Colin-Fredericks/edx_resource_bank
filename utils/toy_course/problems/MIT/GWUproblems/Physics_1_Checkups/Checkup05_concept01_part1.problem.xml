      <p>A small block of mass <i>m</i> sits on a horizontal and frictionless table.  It is attached to a wall by a spring.  The block is initially located at x = 0 when the spring 
      is unstretched (equilibrium position).  You pull the block away from the equilibrium position, out to x = A, and then release it.  The 
      block then oscillates horizontally back and forth in simple harmonic motion.  
      </p>

<p>Which of the statements below are true about the magnitude of the acceleration?  Check all that apply.</p>

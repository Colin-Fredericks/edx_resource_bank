  <p>
A time \(t_0\) a bowling ball of mass \(m\) and radius \(R\) is  thrown down an alley with an initial speed \(v_0\) and no spin. At a given instant of time \(t_f\)
the ball starts to roll without slipping.  </p>

During the time interval \(t_0 \le t \le t_f\), while the ball is slipping and rolling,
angular momentum is conserved around:

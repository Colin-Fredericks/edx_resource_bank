  <p>
A time \(t_0\) a bowling ball of mass \(m\) and radius \(R\) is  thrown down an alley with an initial speed \(v_0\) and no spin. At a given instant of time \(t_f\)
the ball starts to roll without slipping.  </p>

    </p>
<p>
During the time interval \(t_0 \le t \le t_f\), while the ball is slipping and rolling :</p>
<p>

<b>A.</b> The net torque about the center of mass of the ball is zero. </p>
<p><b>B.</b> The net torque about point Q on the surface is zero. (Point Q is on the straight line described by the point of contact between the ball and the surface).</p>
<p><b>C.</b> The magnitude of the acceleration of the center of mass, \(a_{cm}\) and the magnitude of the angular acceleration \(\alpha\) are such that \(a_{cm}=\alpha R\).</p> 
<p><b>D.</b> The velocity of the center of mass of the ball is constant.</p>
<p><b>E.</b> The acceleration of the center of mass of the ball is constant.

	<p>My answer to part 1 is justified because:</p>
	<multiplechoiceresponse direction="vertical" randomize="yes">
		<choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The block-wedge system's total kinetic energy 
			increases during that time interval.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">The block-wedge system's total kinetic 
			energy is constant during that time interval.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="true">The mechanical energy of the block-wedge-Earth 
			system is constant during that time interval.</choice>
			<choice location="random" correct="false">There is no friction, therefore the mechanical 
			energy of the block-Earth system is conserved.</choice>

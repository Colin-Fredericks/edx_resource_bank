<problem>

	<p>A tennis ball is dropped from a very large height to the ground. The ball's speed right before hitting the ground is the same
	as the speed right after it bounces off the ground (it undergoes a perfectly elastic collision with the ground).
	 </p>

	<h3>Part 1</h3>
	<p>What is the direction and the magnitude of the ballâ€™s acceleration the instant <i>after</i> it hits the ground? Assume that the air resistance is <b>negligible</b>.</p>

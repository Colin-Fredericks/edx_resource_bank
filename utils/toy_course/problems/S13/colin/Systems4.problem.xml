<p>In the image above, block 1 is stacked on top of block 2. The blocks are at rest on a flat plane, with gravity present.</p>

<p>We want to choose a system that will allow us to find the normal force (or contact force) between blocks 1 and 2. Assuming we know 
the masses of the objects and the contact force between the table and block 2, what system will let us do this?</p>
